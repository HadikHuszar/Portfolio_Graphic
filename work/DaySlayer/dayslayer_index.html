            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p class="size-large">
              DaySlayer™ is the name of my capstone project while attending the
              Techtonica bootcamp. It received the greatest praise from each
              cohort and staff member, and is currently being prepared for
              adaptation.
            </p>
            <p>
              My idea was to build a web-based application that assisted the
              Daily Team Leaders to lead effortlessly with its powerful
              features. The program has been designed and adapted for members of
              Techtonica's cohorts, but it is easily adaptable for other
              curricula.

            <h4>The Problem Being Solved</h4>
            <p>
              The goal of DaySlayer™ was to solve the biggest problem with being
              a team's Day Lead: struggling with assembling the vast amount of
              information from disparate sources and tools to lead the team. The
              information resided in a half-dozen places, which needed to be
              parsed and then assembled into one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result was that every day, Team Leads would be scrambling to
              gather all this information, adding to the already demanding job
              of being the day leader. This issue is resolved by my application,
              which automates the process of compiling all necessary data in one
              location. As a result, instead of performing the "daily
              quarterback scramble," the Team Lead may begin the day in
              tranquility and concentrate on leading the team, instead.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
            <h4>The Engineered Solution</h4>
            <p>
              My application was built on offering a tool to make team
              leadership simple, allowing the day's Team Lead to focus on
              empowering the team for peak performance. Built on the PERN stack,
              the application is a software program that works as an
              interactive, yet guided, leadership tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guiding the user through the steps necessary to provide all the
              information needed to lead the team for the day, the application's
              Dashboard automatically pulls from various Google calendars the
              team is subscribed to and consolidates it into one place. While
              using APIs to generate the motivational quotes and meditation
              guides needed for the day, it also generates its own information,
              such as the built-in member pairings. The final step of the tool
              allows the user to copy and paste all of the information formatted
              perfectly to be inserted into the team messaging service of
              choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside the Guide section, users are given step-by-step
              instructions on how to lead the various scheduled meetings, which
              the user can check off once it is completed. Links are provided to
              various documents needed for each meeting, which is a huge time
              saver for the Team Lead. No more searching over and over again for
              the same documents and links!
            </p>

          <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
            <h4>User Modeling</h4>
            <p>
              Understanding and designing the demands of the end-user is the
              first step in successfully developing a meaningful and useful
              solution. Personas help us keep focus on the people who will
              actually use the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Persona decisions were created in collaboration with the cohort
              team members. There are 2 main groups of users that are being
              targeted in this application:
            </p>

            <h5>Administrators</h5>
            <p>
              Users who are setting up the initial cohort memberships. Because
              Single Sign On with Google accounts is used, set-up is a
              streamlined process that can be accomplished in minutes.
            </p>
            <h5>Team Members</h5>
            <p>
              Each of the team members represent the end user in a unique way.
              Based on that data and because I use an iterative approach to
              engineering, I needed to adjust the application and the user
              experience along the way.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
            <h4>User Flow</h4>
            <p>
              User flow is a result of listing all possible actions that needs
              to be thoroughly considered, as well as the system behavior in
              each scenario. It gives me the overview of the activities each
              user is able to perform.
            </p>
            <div class="images">
              <img

                data-src="img/UserFlow.png"

              /></noscript>
            </div>
            <p>
              The user flows and the task that the team members would complete
              were based on Techtonica's curricula and their resources.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
            <h4>Final Product</h4>
            <p>
              I closely worked with the cohort team members and curriculum
              admins to understand the end users before I began to develop the
              application in order to deliver a superb user experience that is
              straightforward and ideal for everyone.
            </p>

          <div class="images">
            <img
              draggable="false"
              class="lazy"
              src="../../img/image-placeholder.png"
              data-src="img/Screenshots.jpg"

          <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">
            <h4>The Results</h4>

            <p class="size-large">
              The results gathered from the usability testing were better than
              expected. User satisfaction was very high &mdash; they were really
              happy with how simple and easy it was to utilize the tool to plan
              their day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the effectiveness result was excellent, I still believe
              there is potential for improvement. For example, being able to
              make the step function non-linear so that a user can enter a
              multi-step flow at any point of the flow. A management panel to
              control automated features would also be desirable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the efficiency was the biggest success. The effort that
              users needed to put in to create the Day Lead tasks was
              significantly less than what would be required without DaySlayer™.
              This was made feasible by offering a user experience that truly
              satisfies the demands of the users, turning DaySlayer™ into a
              valuable tool that attained the targeted goals.

<!-- //////////////////// Removed Design Considerations ///////////////////// -->

<!-- <div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">		
    <h4>Design Considerations</h4>
    <p>
Before I could continue with the process, I needed to collaborate with my cohort team members to lay down basic requirements that are needed for creating a great user experience. Creating an application for a diverse group of users needs requires certain design considerations.
    </p>
</div>

    
<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">		
    <h5>Colors</h5>
    <p>
Colors have a very psychological influence on the users. Age is a powerful factor in our reactions to certain colors. Proof of this is the fact that our color preferences change over time and through different periods of our life. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>Color choices made:
    <li>Using monochromatic background to maintain neutrality with regard to color preferences</li>
    <li>Using blue accents that relaxes the user</li>
    <li>Using orange color for highlighting and reinforcement of actions taken, due to its brightness</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>


<div class="max-width-70 text-color-black">		
    <h5>Shapes and forms</h5>
    <p>
Detection of forms depends on the form of the disease and needs of children. For example, children with dyslexia have a significant low processing and perceptions, what means that the child will need more time for perception of shapes.
